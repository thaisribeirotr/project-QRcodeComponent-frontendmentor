## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
  - Display: Flexbox

### Continued development

I still see some issue with the code from "Front-End Mentor" where we give it attribution for the challenge. It is overlapping the QR Code Component when in smaller sizes. I will come back latter to try an figure out how to solve it with flex-box.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Froggy] (https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This helped me in understanding a bit better about flexbox and how it works.
